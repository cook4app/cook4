<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Dear user,</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Thank you for choosing Cook4. C4 (we like calling it that
    way, too!) aims to allow anyone to share his or her food with others, in the spirit of trust and
    sharing.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This section outlines the main functions of C4. Should you
    have any question, feedback or comment, do not hesitate to get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a
            href="mailto:cook4info@gmx.com" target="_blank">hello@cook4app.com</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Enjoy the read and see you soon on C4!</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Main Cook4 sections</h3>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Buy!</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In this section, you'll find the dishes prepared by other
    users.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By default, dishes are ordered according to their
    proximity to you, which is based on their date/time and location.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By clicking the magnifying lens icon on top-right, you'll
    be able to filter the dishes based on: location, name, tags (e.g., "Dessert", "Chinese" or
    "vegan") and date/time.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By cliking on any dish, you'll be able to check it in
    detail, buy it or propose to the cook a swap with a dish of yours.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sell!</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In this section, you can put your own dishes on sale.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The first step is to create the dish. You can do so via
    the "Add a dish!" button, adding the information needed and one or more pictures. It's very
    important to add appropriate tags to your dish, since they'll ease its identification by users
    when they search.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Subsequently, you can put your dish on sale. You can do so
    right after creating it, or anytime after that, since dishes you create are automatically stored
    in the section "Registered dishes". Selling a dish requires to input the following
    information</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li dir="ltr">Minimum data:
        <ul>
            <li dir="ltr">Delivery and/or collection transportation mode</li>
            <li dir="ltr">Dish price for each transportation mode</li>
            <li dir="ltr">Date and time of dish availability</li>
            <li dir="ltr">Reference address (either for the buyer to collect the dish or, if you as
                the cook want to deliver it, for C4 to compute the user's distance and block users
                too far)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">Optional data (you can enter them by clicking the downward arrow on the right)
        <ul>
            <li dir="ltr">Preparation time, in case you as the cook want to prepare the dish only if
                purchased by others. For example, setting the minimum notice time as 24h, the dish
                will disappear from section "Buy" 24h before the date/time in which it will be
                available, so you'll avoid cooking it unless anyone has bought it by then
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr">Maximum distance that you as the cook are willing to cover, if you have
                selected the option of yourself delivering the dish to the buyer
            </li>
            <li dir="ltr">Number of dish portions</li>
            <li dir="ltr">Frequency of the offer, that is, whether it's a one-off or a repeat one,
                in which case you'll be asked to enter the date range and frequency
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once your dish is on sale, it will be visible for all other users in
    the section "Buy!". It will then disappear when all its portions have been bought or after its
    date and time (minus the advance notice time, if you set any).</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Whether or not on sale, all the dishes you've created will
    remain in the section "Sell!", under "Registered dishes". This way, all ratings your dishes
    receive will stick with them and as you put them on sale again they'll be visible. You can
    nonetheless remove any dish from this list at any point in time.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Swap</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In this section, you'll find the swap proposals that you
    made or received but haven't been accepted or rejected yet. It is therefore possible, from this
    section, to accept or reject the swap proposals received and check the status of the ones you
    made to other users.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When a swap proposal is accepted by the receiver, C4
    removes it form this section and originates two transactions for each of the two users. These
    will be immediately visible in the section "Transactions". When a swap proposal is rejected by
    the receiver or canceled by the proposer before any response, C4 simply removes it from this
    section and originates no other transactions.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Transactions</strong></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In this section, you can see all the dishes that you
    ordered from other users ("To receive") or the ones that other users ordered from you ("To
    prepare"). Every time a user buys a dish from you, you'll receive a notification on your phone
    and the transaction will automatically appear in this section.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By clicking on any transaction, the person who will
    phisically go to collect or deliver the dish will see the full details of the exchange address.
    A link to Google Maps will also show the directions to reach there.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">As a transaction is completed, each user will see, in this
    section and in relation to that transaction, a message inviting them to rate the coutnerpart. As
    soon as the vote is given, the transaction will disappear from this section.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Finally, from this section it is also possible to cancel a
    pending transaction. However, this automatically triggers a negative score for the user, which
    everyone else will see and may therefore prevet the user from using Cook4 in the future.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Evaluating dishes and users</h3>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Both cooks and buyers, after each transaction, evaluate
    the counterpart from the section "Transactions". Evaluations are on a scale from 1 (lowest) to 5
    (highest) and cover:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li dir="ltr">Service quality (given by both users), concerning the quality of the interaction
        with the other user. This includes, for example, punctuality, courtesy, availability and
        reliability
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">Dish quality (given only by the buyer to the cook), concerning the quality of the
        food
    </li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Based on these reciprocal evaluations, when a users
    explores the dishes on offer and their cooks, s/he can check four aspects:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
    <li dir="ltr">Dish rating, shown next to the dish name</li>
    <li dir="ltr">User's overall evaluation (e.g., "Beginner" or "Chef", plus related score), based
        on the combination of service and dish quality ratings received
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">Cook evaluation (only score), based only on the dish quality ratings received</li>
    <li dir="ltr">Proximity index (a number in a small golden circle next to the cook's name), which
        automatically identifies "reliable" users. Number 1 indicates users that you yourself
        previously rated 4 or 5, while number 2 indicates cooks that were previously ranked 4 or 5
        not by you, but by other users whom you voted 4 or 5&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Communications</h3>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">With C4, it is possible to easily speak with other users,
    as well as with our team.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">To write to other users, you can use the chat icon (a
    comics bubble) from the page of any dish on sale. This way, you can ask the cook for additional
    information on his/her dish, or for a possible change in the delivry time.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">To write to us, in addition to our e-mail address (<a
        href="mailto:cook4info@gmx.com" target="_blank">hello@cook4app.com</a>), you can use the
    "Report" button placed next to each dish and user profile page. This botton, a bell-shaped icon,
    allows you to notify us of any content or behaviour you consider inappropriate. This will allow
    us to investigate at the earliest and take any action needed.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
