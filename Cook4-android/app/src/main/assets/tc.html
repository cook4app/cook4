<p>• "Conditions": The rules guiding the use of Cook4 and/or its services, included in this
    document</p>

<p><b>3. Service and use</b></p>

<p>Cook4 aims to allow its users to exchange food portions between each other, in exchange for a
    financial payment, the swap with other food or for free. Cook4 is a platform through which users
    can propose their dishes to others, contact other users and agree with other users on the
    details of the dish sale, swap or giving for free. Since this food exchange stems purely from a
    courtesy-based relationship, cooks cannot be considered as professionals practicing an activity
    of restaurant or any other food provision. The cooks, therefore, cannot commit to and guarantee
    compliance on all the legal duties that concern such professionals. As a consequence, all users,
    and foodies more specifically, cannot expect cooks to fulfil all such obligations, but rather to
    operate at their best in the preparation and delivery of food items.</p>

<p>In order to offer a dish via Cook4, cooks will need to register with Cook4 and create the dish
    itself, which includes the indication of relevant information such as: dish name, identifying
    tags, dish description and one or more pictures of the dish. Subsequently, cooks will need to
    define the offer related to the dish, specifying: choice of collection and/or delivery options,
    price for each option, number of portions, time of dish availability, minimum advance notice
    needed for its preparation and finally the date of dish availability.</p>

<p>All Cook4 users will see the dishes offered by the cooks in the related section of the app. From
    this section, all users will be able to propose the purchase or swap to the cook, except the
    cook herself/himself who cannot make any of these actions with her/his own dishes. In case of
    purchase, the foodie needs only to select the option of collection or delivery (depending on
    which was made available by the cook), the number of portions and eventually confirm the
    purchase with the related button. In case of swap (i.e., barter), foodies will make all the
    selections described above but then select the button "Swap" instead of "Buy".</p>

<p>After the purchase, Cook4 generates a notification of the upcoming transaction and sends it to
    both parties, including the details related to the place of the exchange. Both parties can
    review this information at any time, from the related section in the app. Also after the swap
    proposal, Cook4 generates a notification of the proposal and sends it to both parties. This will
    be converted into a normal upcoming transaction if the cook accepts the proposal, while it will
    be simply removed from the app otherwise.</p>

<p>As the date and time of the transaction approach, each party will be able to review the other
    party, through a dedicated section in the app. The foodie will evaluate the cook based on food
    quality and overall reliability (e.g., punctuality, kindness). The cook will evaluate the foodie
    only on the overall reliability.</p>

<p>Each party can cancel a pending transaction anytime before its due date and time. This will
    trigger a notification to the other party and an automated negative score for the user deleting
    the dish.</p>

<p><b>4. User registration</b></p>

<p>When registering with Cook4, users can authenticate themselves in three ways: through their Gmail
    credentials, through their Facebook credentials or through another e-mail address and a password
    to be generated by the user upon registration. </p>

<p>Users commit to:</p>

<p>• Provide real, complete and updated registration data;</p>

<p>• Update their data provided to Cook4 in order to constantly ensure the truthfulness and
    completeness of the data;</p>

<p>• Communicate promptly to Cook4 any loss of confidentiality of their password and/or any use of
    their access data from others and/or any violations of the security measures deployed (as far as
    users are aware) within the services, the app and the website;</p>

<p>• Close their session every time they stop using Cook4 services or the user area;</p>

<p>• Prevent third parties from accessing the app, website and/or Cook4 services by using their own
    access codes</p>

<p>If a user provides registration data and/or information that is false, wrong, not updated or
    incomplete, or if Cook4 has any reason to suspect that such registration data or information is
    false, wrong, not updated or incomplete, Cook4 has the authority to not activate, suspend or
    terminate the account and deny partial or complete use of its services to the user.</p>

<p>Users may receive via e-mail a periodic newsletter from Cook4 and/or other communications from
    Cook4. Shall users wish not to receive any or part of these communications, they'll be able to
    request to leave the mailing list anytime, through a link included in each of such
    communications.</p>

<p><b>5. Changes to personal information</b></p>

<p>Users will be able to update and/or rectify at any time the personal information they had
    provided to Cook4. In order to do so, users will need to access, within the app, the section
    called "Profile". From there, it is possible to change user name and introductory statement, as
    well as to log out of the app. Users are responsible for the truthfulness and correctness of the
    personal information they provide, while Cook4 has no responsibility or liability about it.
    Users will be able to cancel their Cook4 account anytime, by sending an e-mail to <a
            href="mailto:hello@cook4app.com">hello@cook4app.com</a>.</p>

<p><b>6. Data use and privacy</b></p>

<p>Users are the owners of all content and information they publish on Cook4. As concerns the
    contents covered by property rights ("IP contents"), for example photos and videos, users grant
    to Cook4 a non-exclusive transferable license, free from royalties and valid worldwide, for the
    use of any IP content published on Cook4 or in connection with Cook4 ("IP license"). The IP
    license ends when users delete their Cook4 account or the IP contents from their account, unless
    such contents have previously been shared with third parties and these third parties haven't
    deleted them yet. When users delete IP contents, these contents are deleted in a way similar to
    the emptying of a computer bin folder. However, IP contents may be stored as backup copies for a
    given time frame, although not visible to others.</p>

<p>Users acknowledge and accept that Cook4 has the right to store their registration data, log data
    and other information related to the users' activity on Cook4 and to use the results, statistics
    and analyses of these activities in compliance with the applicable laws. Cook4 has the right to
    disclose to third parties the information above mentioned, in order to comply with legal
    obligations or any orders received from public authorities, including the judicial one. Cook4
    may disclose to third parties the information above mentioned also in order to counter any
    complaints received, as well as to protect the rights of Cook4, its users, app and/or website
    visitors in compliance with the applicable laws and with the present conditions.</p>

<p>Users allow Cook4, and other users to whom Cook4 has granted this right, to use their data in the
    limits and means required to manage and complete their transactions. At any time, users can ask
    and obtain that some of their information is not stored on Cook4. This may lead to the partial
    or complete non-functioning of Cook4 for these users.</p>

<p>Cook4 takes various measures to guarantee the protection of its users' personal information.
    Nonetheless, Cook4 cannot guarantee the absolute security and inviolability of this information.
    By accepting these conditions, users understand and agree with the fact that Cook4 does not
    provide this guarantee and therefore users accept to use Cook4 while being aware of this
    possibility.</p>

<p>By accepting these conditions, cooks authorize Cook4 to associate promotional messages and its
    own trade marks and/or distinctive traits to the content generated by the cook herself/himself,
    by publishing them on Cook4 app and/or website. By accepting these conditions, cooks authorize
    Cook4 also to use the name, trade marks and distinctive traits of the cook herself/himself in
    press releases and promotional messages aimed to promote Cook4 and its services.</p>

<p>The data and content related to users may be used by Cook4 in order to send information and
    commercial offers, also from third parties. Users will be able to interrupt such communications
    towards them at any time, through a link included within each of these communications and, in
    any case, by sending a related request to <a
            href="mailto:hello@cook4app.com">hello@cook4app.com</a>.</p>

<p>Cook4 can change these rules about data registration and privacy at any time. Changes will apply
    starting from the date in which the new rules are published and communicated to all Cook4
    users.</p>

<p><b>8. Violation of these conditions</b></p>

<p>Any user's violation of one or more of the conditions outlined in this document will trigger the
    temporary or definitive (total or partial) block of the accounts of the users involved, made
    directly by Cook4.</p>

<p>Such violations would also give to Cook4 and/or other users and/or third parties involved the
    right to appeal to a court against the authors of the violations, in order to secure the
    compensation for the damage received.</p>

<p><b>9. Limitation of liability</b></p>

<p><b>9a. Functioning of Cook4</b></p>

<p>Cook4 manages its app and website and controls their functioning from Italy. Cook4 doesn't
    guarantee that the app, the website and the services offered will be usable and/or accessible in
    any geography worldwide.</p>

<p>Cook4 will deploy its capabilities in order to try and ensure the availability and functionality
    of its app, website and services, however Cook4 cannot guarantee that the app, website and
    services offered will be available all the time.</p>

<p>In particular, Cook4 will have no liability in case the malfunctioning of the app and/or website
    and/or services will depend on:</p>

<p>• Unauthorized or wrong use of the app, website and/or services;</p>

<p>• Partial or no functioning of the user's hardware and/or software;</p>

<p>• Any facts depending on the responsibility of web providers and telecom companies;</p>

<p>• Malfunctioning of the internet and/or phone network;</p>

<p>• Generally, any event not due to Cook4 or its employees;</p>

<p>• Unauthorized access to the IT system of Cook4 by the user or a third party;</p>

<p>• Problems of force majeure or anyway not depending on the willingness and/or responsibility of
    Cook4</p>

<p>Cook4 may contain links to other websites and/or apps, to which users may be redirected. Such
    websites and/or apps are not monitored or controlled by Cook4, hence Cook4 bears no
    responsibility over their content and functioning.</p>

<p><b>9b. Contents</b></p>

<p>Under no circumstance, Cook4 will be liable for the contents published by the users, such as, for
    example, errors or omissions in the content or loss or damage of any content.</p>

<p>Users acknowledge and agree with the fact that Cook4 will make security copies of the
    user-generated contents as reasonably needed, however Cook4 bears no responsibility towards the
    risk of loss of user-generated contents.</p>

<p>Cook4 does not exert any control over the contents published by its users, although Cook4 has the
    right, upon discovering illicit or harmful content, to remove such content from the app and/or
    website and delete it.</p>

<p>In any case, Cook4 has the right to change or delete from its app and/or website any contents
    that do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, as well as with the present
    conditions.</p>

<p><b>9c. Transactions</b></p>

<p>Cook4 is not a producer or provider of the dishes offered by the cooks, nor does it play any
    active role in the transactions among users.</p>

<p>Cook4 does not play the role of agent or mediator, while it is a provider of services aimed to
    allow the conclusion of transactions among users. Cook4 has no liability over the fulfilment of
    the obligations that users take on by concluding the transactions on the app or website (e.g.,
    delivery, payment, warranty, termination, other).</p>

<p>Cook4 does not guarantee to control the identity and reliability of all users, the quality of all
    the dishes offered by the users and the truthfulness and exhaustiveness of all user-generated
    contents. Users are responsible to make proper checks on the identify and reliability of the
    users they want to deal with, on the quality of the dishes offered by the cooks and on the
    truthfulness and exhaustiveness of the contents generated by other users.</p>

<p>Cook4 does not take on any obligation to promote cooks and/or dishes but it provides users with
    the tools needed to ease their activity of promotion and communication about their dishes.</p>

<p><b>9d. Warranties</b></p>

<p>Beyond the warranties provided by these conditions, Cook4 excludes any liability, warranty,
    commitment or declaration of any sort, expressed or implicit, by law or other nature, in any way
    related to the app, website and/or services offered by Cook4. This limitation of liability
    includes, for example, any warranty of tradability, quality or suitability to any purpose of the
    products traded or swapped.</p>

<p>In some countries and jurisdictions, the limitation of liability is not allowed. Therefore, the
    limitation of liability outlined above may not be applicable and users may then be entitled to
    additional rights attributed to them by law.</p>

<p>In general terms, Cook4 does not guarantee that its app and/or website and/or services offered
    will fully fulfil the requests of users and that their functioning will be uninterrupted and
    free from any errors, nor does Cook4 guarantee that any defects in its app and/or website and/or
    services offered will be corrected.</p>

<p><b>9e. Damages</b></p>

<p>All users use the app, website and services of Cook4 at their own risk.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent allowed by applicable laws and regulations, under no circumstance Cook4 or
    its employees or its collaborators will be liable towards the users (or third parties advancing
    any request) for damages that are direct, indirect, consequential, incidental, special or
    punitive, nor for losses of any sort, including loss of profits, loss of contracts, activity
    interruption, loss or damaging of data. These limitations of liability apply, no matter their
    cause and whether they occur within contractual terms or as a result of illegal behaviour,
    including negligence, even if Cook4 had been previously warned about the possibility of such
    damages happening.</p>

<p>Shall any exclusion, restriction or other limitation of liability included in these conditions be
    judged null for any reason by a competent jurisdiction, and shall Cook4 as a consequence become
    liable for any loss or damage of which the amount could be legitimately assessed, the liability
    of Cook4, be it of contractual, civil or other nature, will under no circumstance exceed the
    amount of 1.00 Euro.</p>

<p><b>10. Indemnity</b></p>

<p>Every user commits to indemnify Cook4, its representatives, administrators, employees and
    partners from any request of compensation, including legal expenses, advanced by third parties

    website and/or services) or advanced by any other person accessing the app, the website and/or
    the services offered by Cook4 with the user's access codes.</p>

    users will demonstrate their implicit acceptance of the changes made.</p>

<p>Cook4 has the right to suspend or delete the registration account of the users, as well as

    actual or anticipated violation of the most recent version of these conditions.</p>
